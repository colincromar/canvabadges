    <p>We’re excited to announce that we’ll be starting the retirement process for Canvabadges the week of April 30th and migrating all existing users over to Badgr.</p>
    <p>Badgr is free to use and offers a number of compelling features including a built-in leaderboard. The Badgr Team will be offering a webinar on the transition as well as a transition guide. All existing Canvabadges will automatically appear in Badgr as part of the transition. Canvabadges will be shutdown, with access to non-migrated data unrecoverably lost, on December 31st 2018.</p>
    <p>Please contact your CSM if you have any questions about the transition.</p>

        <p>NOTE: Canvabadges is not actively being maintained, I've unfortunately had to move on
          to <a href="https://www.mycoughdrop.com">other projects</a>.
          Feel free to tweet at me if you have questions, but no guarantees that I'll be able to help
          with them. Also let me know if you're interested in owning the project :-). If you're looking
          for an alternative, I'd suggest <a href="http://info.badgr.io/">Badgr</a> or possibly
          <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a> depending on your use case.

        <%= @org.settings['name'] %> let you award badges to students in courses based on their total
        grade in the course and their completion of course modules. You can also put
        a manual approval step on as well that requires your final sign-off before they
        receive the badge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put it all together and you've got some lightweight course credentials!
        Badges can be added to a <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Backpack</a>,
        or you can drop <a href="/canvas_profile_badges.js<%= "?path_prefix=#{request.env['badges.path_prefix']}" if request.env['badges.path_prefix'].length > 0 %>">this javascript file</a> in your
        global Canvas scripts to let users add them to their Canvas
        profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: Students do not earn badges automatically, they must launch the Canvabadges link in modules
        after completing criteria in order to be awarded the badge.

      Lots of schools will probably want to host their
      own badge issuing server, so the domain matches their school
      (i.e. badges.utah.edu instead of canvabadges.herokuapp.com).
      Good news! You can now do that with Canvabadges! Just
      <% if BadgeHelper.issuer['owner_url'] == "https://twitter.com/whitmer" %>
        <a href="https://github.com/whitmer/canvabadges#getting-your-canvas-working-with-wwwcanvabadgesorg">follow
        these directions</a> on getting a custom domain configured.
      <% else %>
        <a href="<%= BadgeHelper.issuer['owner_url'] %>">contact
        the site's owner</a> about getting a custom domain configured.
      <% end %>
      Or you can also run
      <a href="https://github.com/whitmer/canvabadges">the code</a>
      yourself.
